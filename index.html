          During the Hackathon “Build for Belarus”, we created PeopleFinder, as
          a solution for finding missing people. We make it possible for people
          who are in search for their missing relatives and friends to get more
          information about his or her last activity that was captured on a
          photo or video in the open data sources.

        <p class="first-block-text">
          We created a Telegram bot where people could upload a picture of the
          missing person. With the help of face recognition technology, our
          system would tell whether there is a match between an uploaded photo
          and data from the open sources or not. If there is a match, it means
          that a missing person was pictured on a photo or video from the public
          sources. It would hint to a person, where his relative/friend noticed
          the last time. Also, we have a single-page website as a backup for
          people to upload pictures of missing people if Telegram is down or
          does not want to use it.
